## Loans borrowers task: 

Authors: Marcos Barragán and Adrián González

We develope several classification models trying to predict the loan default payment. We include: 

- EDA, transformation and cleaning data variables
- Logistic regression.
- SVM
- Random Forest
- XG Boost

In every model we will show the prediction accuracy, the time it has spent calculating and the ROC representation for each accuracy.
